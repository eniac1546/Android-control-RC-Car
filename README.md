# Android-control-RC-Car
We can control a rc car's movements using an android smartphone with some application which are available in the playstore.

We need some components for this projects
Component list

1. 1 car chassis it can be small or large or it can hold two motor or 4 motors.

2. 12v DC geared motors 4 nos or 2 nos acording to your project (I used 300 RPM motors you can use more RPM to increase the speed of the rc car).

3.12 v DC battery (I used lead acid for this project). you also can use rechargable lipo batteries.

4. Motor Driver - I used L298n H bridge motor driver (If you are using 4 motors this driver is suggested) or else you can use L293d (For two motors)

5. Bluetooth Module - You can use either HC05 or HC06 bluetooth moduleboth will work for this project.

6.Arduino- You can use Arduini uno as well as arduino nano (Arduinio uno is preferred as it will reduce the wirings from the bread board).

7. Bread Board -(It's upto you. I havent use the breadboard in this project, but i used the breadboard while primery testing)

8. Cluster Wheel - Not nacessory for 4 wheel car, but if you are gonna make it a  two primery wheel car then  you need a cluster wheel.

9. Jumper Wires - You need male to male and male to female jumper wires for this project 40 in total (I got some extra to extend the wirings from the motors).

10. Wheels - You can use normal wheels. (I used drifting wheels for racing purpose. It cost 10 time more then a normal wheel) .

11. An android smart phone.

12. Arduino Bluetooth RC Car - You need this application to control
